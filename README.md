## Supplier Management App
This is a web application for managing suppliers. It is an extension of the Stock Management project we made in class.

## Functionality

Users can add details of a supplier, including the supplier name, address, and phone numbers. A "Save" button is available to save the supplier to the collection "suppliers" in Atlas MongoDB.

## Supplier Management Page
The Supplier Management Page is accessible from the top navigation bar. It has the following functionalities:

Show a table of all suppliers sorted by name.
.Delete a supplier record.
.Update a supplier record.
.A button to create a new Supplier, which links to the previous supplier page.


## Usability
In fact, I can implement all the functionality on localhost:3000. Except the sort by name function. But, when I upload to vercel, There is a 500 problem appeared.



## Styling
The app features a stunning design and styling with professional CSS. The default Bootstrap Style is used as a base.
